Creator
* Factory: Not like our SaveGameFactory... also not to be confused with Abstract Factory.
* Builder: Makes it possible to incrementally construct an object.
  - Pizza example.
* Object Mother

Information Expert
* Similar to the Single Responsibity Principle.
  - Keeps single objects from being over loaded.

Low Coupling
* Objects should have the least amount of dependancies.

High Cohesion
* Multiple seperate objects (dependant on eachother) used for differnt implementations.
  - All objects are relatable without coupling.

Controller
* Doesn't do any real work. Rather it delegates what information is communicated from one place to another.
  - Controls small chucks of work at a time.
  
Indirection
* Breaks up chunks of work for delecation.
  - Similar to Controller
  
Polymorphism
* Avoid conditions on Types

Protected Variations
* Is a concept of immutability.
  - Protects how your objects can/cannot change.

Pure Fabrication
* When your code gets too big, you can pull some objects out of the class and fabricate new objects for other uses or classes.
  - Example: Attack Command code could be simplified using Pure Fabrication.
